# Create a database called tracks.db
# Create 3 tables:
#    1. Artist (id, name)
#    2. Album (id, artist_id, title)
#    3. Track (id, title, album_id, track_duration_in_seconds, rating, play_count)
# Study the file "Library.xml". Look at how the data is structured.
# For each track that occurs in the file, insert records into the Artist, Album and Track tables.
# If the Artist already exists, or if the Album already exists, then you should not insert a new entry in those tables.
# Make sure that the "id" fields are primary keys with auto-increment.
